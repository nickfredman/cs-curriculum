Below is a recommended multi-year progression that moves from foundational topics to advanced, while integrating the resources listed previously. To help you navigate, each phase (about one year) focuses on a particular layer of the stack, building up from math and low-level systems, then moving on to higher-level software engineering, cloud infrastructure, frontend, and finally advanced AI/ML and specialization areas. Alongside the roadmap, you’ll find suggested editions of books and links to courses, YouTube lectures, and other resources where available. Use this as a flexible template—adjust pacing based on your background and progress.

Note: Where possible, links are provided. For some official courses (like MIT and Stanford), the exact “year” version might change, but we’ll reference well-known stable resources. For textbooks, the newest edition is generally best.

Tips for Using This Roadmap
	•	Stay Current: For courses, always check the latest offering year. For example, “MIT 6.006” from 2011 is still solid, but also look for newer lecture sets if available.
	•	Supplement with YouTube Channels & Conferences:
	•	GOTO Conference channel: GOTO Conferences YouTube
	•	ACM and IEEE Talks
	•	Google Tech Talks
	•	Books Editions: Always get the most recent edition to stay up-to-date, especially for fast-moving fields like cloud and ML.
	•	Adjust Pace & Depth: Spend extra time on areas that interest you most or where you feel weaker. The 10-year plan is ample time to revisit fundamentals and delve deeper.

This ordered, multi-year roadmap—with references to editions of books, direct links to courses, and structured sequencing—should give you a clear path forward. Adjust as technology evolves and new, improved courses and editions become available.
